- **Save From Anywhere:** Works seamlessly across YouTube—on the homepage, in subscription feeds, search results, and on video watch pages.

    - **Download as File:** Save your current video list as a `.txt` file for your records.
- **In-List Actions:** Click any video in the popup to open a context menu to either navigate to the video's URL or remove it from the list.
