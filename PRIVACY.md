# Privacy Policy for YouTube Rightclick

**Effective Date: August 1, 2025**

Thank you for using YouTube Rightclick. Your privacy is critically important to us. This extension is designed to be simple, secure, and respectful of your data. This policy outlines how we handle information.

The core principle of this extension is: **Your data is your own. All information collected and stored by this extension remains on your local computer and is never transmitted to us or any third party.**

## Information We Collect and Why

To perform its function, the extension needs to handle two types of data:

#### 1. Website Content
When you use the extension to save a video (either via right-click or the popup button), it reads the following information from the active `youtube.com` page:

*   **Video Title:** The title of the video you are saving.
*   **Video URL:** The web address of the video you are saving.

This information is essential for the extension's core purpose: creating your CSV list of videos. We do not read or access any other content from the webpage.

#### 2. User Activity
The extension is only activated by your direct actions. We collect data on these specific interactions to trigger the extension's features:

*   **Clicks** on the "Add video to CSV" context menu item.
*   **Clicks** on the "Add Current Video" button in the popup.

We do not track any other browsing activity, mouse movements, or keystrokes.

## How and Where Your Information is Stored

The list of video titles and URLs that you create is saved using the standard `chrome.storage.local` API. This means:

*   Your data is stored **only on your own computer**, within the secure storage area that your browser allocates for this extension.
*   Your video list is **never sent to, stored on, or accessed by our servers**. We have no access to it.
*   Clearing your browser's data or uninstalling the extension will permanently delete this list.

## Third-Party Services

This extension **does not use any third-party services**. It does not integrate with any external APIs, trackers, or analytics tools.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this policy from time to time if the extension's functionality changes. We encourage you to review this policy periodically. The latest version will always be available at this location.
