Permission: downloads

Justification: This permission is required for the "Download List" feature, which is a core part of the extension's functionality. It allows users to export and save their curated video lists as a local .txt file on their computer. This provides users with a way to back up their data, access it offline, and port it to other applications. The extension only initiates a file download when the user explicitly clicks the "Download List" button within the popup. The user is always prompted to choose a save location, giving them full control over the process.
